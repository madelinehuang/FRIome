Files for DIY Diagnostic's FRIome project

Main files: 
- Jupyter Notebooks/Ttest-Anova-Calc.ipynb
	This is where all my code is
- Jupyter Notebooks/MasterSheet.csv
	Master spreadsheet that contains the data inputted into Ttest-Anova-Calc
- Jupyter Notebooks/MasterSheetKey.csv
	Key for the categories
Other Notebooks (probably wonâ€™t run since input files are in other folders):
- PhylumCorrelation is my very first file which calculates correlation matrices for 1 category (gender) on bacteria phylums
- Class-GraphingComparison graphs and compares bacteria classes and subcategories for 1 category (gender)
Filtering Data - Some highlighted files while I was deciding which samples/categories to use
Original files - data downloaded/selected from the database 
BacteriaInfoDump.xlsx - starting file when I was trying to get a big picture of the data
